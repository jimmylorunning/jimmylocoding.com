I'm a web developer, writer, artist, biker, tennis player, and reader living in Atlanta. This is my coding blog. But I have many interests outside of coding, which you can find by following one of these links:

- [jimmylorunning](http://jimmylorunning.com) my personal homepage, featuring some of my creative writing
- [goodreads](http://goodreads.com/jimmylorunning) book reviews and recommendations
- [letters from hong kong](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUmjc7j2y7Q) a short documentary I made about hong kong and my family
- [i love you something](http://iloveyousomething.com) my personal blog, which needs updating
- [free poems on demand](http://freepoemsatl.org) public performance art project where I write poems for strangers
- [deviant art](http://jimmylorunning.deviantart.com/) my paintings, drawings, and other doodles
