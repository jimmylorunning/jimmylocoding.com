Here are some projects I've worked on. Most have GitHub repositories. Some have associated blog posts.

### Lilt.js

A jQuery plugin for making a div with a shadow that moves as you scroll down the page. The effect is similar in idea to the parallax effect. But with shadows.

### Twitter Fitter

Combine any 2 Twitter feeds with this app! Create surprising and fun phrases! Give this app any two Twitter handles, and it will generate a few new tweets based on the 2 Twitter user's past handles. It's a markov chain. And it's fun. You can even retweet the results from the Twitter Fitter account.
