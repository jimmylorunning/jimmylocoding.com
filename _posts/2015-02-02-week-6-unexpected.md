Last week was all about being overwhelmed. This week was all about the unexpected.
<ul>
	<li><strong>SaaS homework:</strong> I did not expect to spend 15 hours (more if you count the fact that I spent another 3 hours refactoring after I was done) on this assignment. It's definitely the most involved homework assignment so far (although there were a few in SaaS 1 that were pretty difficult too). I won't go into it in detail here because I already <a href="http://jimmylocoding.com/saas-legacy-homework-2-lessons-learned/">wrote a blogpost about it</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Exquisite Source:</strong> I did not expect to write <a href="https://still-sands-5922.herokuapp.com/about.php">this</a>. But I got inspired by an article on pull requests! And it was a very simple non-ambitious project technically speaking... with a (perhaps too) ambitious idea behind it. So we'll see if it takes off. Hopefully it helps someone. If it doesn't, it was only a couple hours of pretty fun work.</li>
	<li><strong>My first JQuery plugin</strong>? I will write a separate blog post about this soon. But umm... I wrote a JQuery plugin! And it's open source. And it was the last thing I expected to do this week, but I just got caught up in a very small idea that I thought others could re-use. More soon.</li>
</ul>
