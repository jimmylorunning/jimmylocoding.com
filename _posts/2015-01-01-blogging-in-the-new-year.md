title: Blogging in the New Year
---


Happy new year and welcome to jimmylocoding! This will be a space for me to document my journey learning Ruby on Rails (and inevitably many other things along the way and beyond). Hopefully it will be somewhat interesting/educational for others.

My Rails journey started around January 2014, but life took over before I could get through Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial. About two months ago, I decided to pick up where I left off--here are some of the things I've done since:
<ul>
  <li>Started going to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atlantaruby/">Ruby meetups</a></li>
  <li>Started going to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/codeforatlanta/">codeforatlanta</a> (civic hacking) meeups/hackathons</li>
  <li>Did a bunch of katas on <a href="http://codewars.com/">codewars.com</a> -- I highly recommend this, it made me start to "think Ruby"</li>
  <li>Took this <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x">EdX.org class on SaaS</a> -- this was super helpful, and I will blog about this more in the future</li>
  <li>Got really comfortable with git/github, at least the very basic common commands</li>
  <li>Listened to a bunch of podcasts. My favorites are <a href="http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/">Ruby Rogues</a> and <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">Code Newbie</a>. Code Newbie also has an online community of friendly encouraging folks.</li>
  <li>Recently resolved to write a new app every week, even if it's a very simple app</li>
</ul>
This is my second week writing an app per week. Last week, I finally made my very first app outside of following tutorials. It was a bit scary at first to not have that reassuring set of instructions to fall back on.

For my first app, I chose a very simple, some may even say <em>boring</em>, app: a to do list! People kept telling me "Just write an app for practice," and I had planned to do this. But I couldn't think of any good ideas!

Or my ideas were <em>too</em> good and <em>too</em> ambitious, and therefore too intimidating for a first project. Then I realized it doesn't have to be a good idea! I decided that since my first few apps will suck anyway, I should just keep it simple and focus on getting them out as quickly as possible and try to learn as much as I can from them.

If you're curious, you can see the <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/muchtodo">source code</a> of my first app on github or play with it <a href="https://intense-beyond-1562.herokuapp.com/todos">on Heroku</a>. I learned a lot. And even though it could be a lot better, I need to move on to Week Two!

This week, I am working on a message board app, based on the <a href="http://docs.railsbridge.org/intermediate-rails/">RailsBridge curriculum</a>. The curriculum is perfect because it gives me a guide to follow in terms of what to do next without giving me any of the technical hand-holding that tutorials give. So it's still challenging, but with a bit of structure thrown in.

You can see it <a href="https://github.com/jimmylorunning/say-something">on github here</a> and play with it (even in its half finished state) <a href="https://aqueous-sierra-5780.herokuapp.com/">on Heroku</a>. I will be continually deploying it as I finish each part, and blogging about it too. So stay tuned!
