I had an idea this morning while <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/how-to-make-a-pull-request">reading about pull requests</a>: why not have a sandbox-like environment just for people to practice doing pull requests without the fear of messing anything up? And while we're at it, why not make it into a surrealist game, to see what kind of crazy franken-art will come out?

So I went ahead and made it a reality. Introducing <a href="https://still-sands-5922.herokuapp.com/about.php">Exquisite Source</a>! Please have a look around and make your first pull request!
