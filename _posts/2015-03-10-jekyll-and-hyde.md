If you're a longtime reader (as in, the 2 months that this blog has been in existence), you may have noticed some changes. That's because I just changed blogging platforms from WordPress to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).

### Why Change?

In January, I was learning some new things (Rails, Ruby, Agile, etc.) and I had no time to customize a blog the way I liked it. Nevertheless, I needed some place to document what I've learned and connect with people. So I decided to put up a blog as quickly as possible. The only requirement was that it required almost no time to set up. I was already familiar with WordPress, and have set several WordPress blogs up before. So I set it up, downloaded a free theme, and voila! I was in business.

Two and a half months later, I still like my blog a lot, but it seemed cluttered. I start noticing a lot of the other blogs I admired were beautifully minimalistic. The content was front and center. Most of these blogs were hosted on either Ghost, Medium, or GitHub Pages. I decided to look into these options.

### Why GitHub Pages?

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is hosted on GitHub. You automatically get one site per GitHub account, and when you push any changes to it, it gets updated. No further work needed! I was attracted mostly to the convenience of updating the blog where I would update my other code--in my text editor. It reminded me of the early days when the internet was just a bunch of static HTML pages, and I'd log into the server to edit my HTML files directly.

### Why Jekyll?

> GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so in addition to supporting regular HTML content, theyâ€™re also a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free.

Jekyll is so cool! With it, I can write all my posts within my text editor using beautiful [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) instead of ugly HTML or dealing with buggy WYSIWYG interfaces! GitHub Pages and Jekyll provides all the advantages of a static site (speed, simplicity) with all the advantages of a dynamic site ([DRY-ness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)). Every time you push the site, Jekyll generates all the static pages for you based on the templates and code you've written. So despite the fact that it's a static site, if you want to change the layout or colors or even functionality of your site, you can do it in just one place.

Jekyll works with regular HTML pages too, so I didn't have to convert all my old posts to Markdown.

### Setting it up

There's nothing that technically extraordinary about my set-up that I need to write a whole blog post about it. I followed [this tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/), but instead of only using [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), I also used a Poole theme called [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/). The difference? Poole isn't exactly a theme; it comes with all types of default settings on top of Jekyll to help bootstrap you so that you have a solid foundation to build upon. Hyde, on the other hand, <i>is</i> a theme and is built on top of Poole.

The second tutorial I used was [this blog post](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll/) which helped me implement tags.

### Downsides

The only downside is that I've now lost all of the great comments you've left on my blog. I still <i>have</i> them, of course. But they are no longer on this version of the blog for everyone to see. But since I've implemented comments using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), it will be pretty easy for you to leave comments on this site from here on out. You don't even need a Disqus account, as you can use OAuth to log in through Twitter or any of the other social networks.
